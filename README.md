Welcome to "Fazan," a delightful single-player word Java game that will challenge your vocabulary and strategic thinking!<br>
<br>
Gameplay Overview:<br>
In "Fazan," you will play against the computer in a classic word-building duel. The objective is to create words without being blocked by your opponent. The game offers two levels of difficulty to suit players of all skill levels.<br>
<br>
How to Play:<br>
<br>
Starting the Game: Begin by choosing your preferred difficulty level: Easy or Hard.<br>
Easy Mode: In this mode, the computer's list of "dangerous word endings" is reset to include only a few common endings, such as "re" to avoid "restaurant" and "or" to avoid "ornitorinc." This makes it easier for you to win.<br>
Hard Mode: For a more challenging experience, the computer retains its list of word endings from previous games, making it more difficult to outsmart your digital opponent.<br>
<br>
Blocking and Strategy:<br>
<br>
If one of you is blocked during the game, the computer records the first two letters of the blocking word. For example, if you block the computer with the word "teanc," it will note "te" and avoid using words ending in "te" in future games. This strategic element ensures that each game is unique and that the computer becomes progressively smarter over time, adapting to your gameplay style.<br>
<br>
Objective:<br>
<br>
Outmaneuver the computer by finding words that will block it, thus securing your victory.<br>
Whether you are looking for a casual word game or a more competitive challenge, "Fazan" offers endless fun and a chance to sharpen your linguistic skills. Enjoy the game and may the best wordsmith win!<br>
